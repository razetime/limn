# limn
A graphical esoteric language, inspired by [Charcoal](https://github.com/somebody1234/Charcoal) and [<><(Fish)](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish).

The idea behind limn is to create a self modifying language that can create images and ascii art, using the same controls needed to create those things.

## Implemented functionality:

#### Code canvas - complete
* Pushing Strings and Numbers to stack
* Setting direction using arrow commands
* Rotating cursor direction by 45&deg; and 90&deg;
* Choosing a random direction
* Tokenizing an arrow string
* Retrieving data in place
* Self modifying printing
* Conditionals
* Warping
* Typecasting
* Arithmetic ops
* Taking Input
* Copying a Rectangular Area


#### Drawing canvas
* Text and line drawing
* Setting direction
* Rotation of drawing cursor
* Random direction
* Copying an area
* Curve drawing
* Text syle changing
* stroke style changing

#### TODO: 
* flood filling without crashing 
* infinite drawing canvas
* Improve permalink compression
* prevent permalinking from reloading the page
* fix text sizing
* choosing a good monospaced symbol for curve command
